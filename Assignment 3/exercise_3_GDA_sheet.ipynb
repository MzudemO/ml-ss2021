    "\n",
    "1. The goal of this exercise is to build a classifier for real-life data (images).\n",
    "2. You will derive features of the images and then use GDA for classification, i.e., you compute the probability of each image being sampled from one of the classes $j$ (in our case $j \\in \\{\\textrm{no_mask}, \\textrm{mask}\\}$). This probability can be calculated with <br>\n",
    "$p(y=j|x)= \\frac{p(x|y=j)p(y=j)}{p(x|y=j)p(y=j)+p(x|y \\neq j)p(y \\neq j)}$ <br>\n",
    "where <br>\n",
    "$p(x|y=j)=\\frac{1}{(2 \\pi)^{\\frac{n}{2}}|\\Sigma|^{\\frac{1}{2}}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}(x-\\mu_j)^T \\Sigma^{-1} (x-\\mu_0)}$ <br>\n",
    "and the prior probability $p(y=j)=1-\\Phi$ (depending on the dataset).\n",
    "3. For later classification, you compute for each class the probability that the image is a sample of it and choose the class with the highest probability."

    "\n",
    "The dataset contains identically sized images of people with and without facemasks and the goal is to classify if an image contains a person wearing a facemask or not. Note that some images have 3 colors, some also have an alpha channel which you should probably ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the images are loaded, they are represented as a 24x24x3 matrix. One of the 3 layers of the matrix is for the red (R) value, one for the \n",
    "green (G) value and one for the blue (B) value. The image itself is created by taking the values of each of theses 3 matrices at (i,j) to create the \n",
    "pixel of the image at spot (i,j). Each of the values can be in range of 0-255.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you should load in the images (see zip files). There are two versions of the dataset, a small subsample which contains 40 images for each of the two classes, and the large full dataset (with imbalanced classes). There are multiple libraries for image representation. Try PIL or google around."
