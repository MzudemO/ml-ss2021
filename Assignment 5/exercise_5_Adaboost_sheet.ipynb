    "Your implementation of the classifier shall not be limited to a fixed number of feature dimensions (e.g., 2 as in `dataCircle.txt`, or 6 as in your previous work on face detection) but should work with any number of features. However, there's no need to implement the data loading / feature computation for both data sets.\n",
